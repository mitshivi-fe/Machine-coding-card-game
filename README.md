- Node.js (version 14.x or later)
- Angular CLI (version 10.x)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/mitshivi-fe/Machine-coding-card-game.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd machine-coding-card-game

3. Install the dependencies: npm install

4. Run the application in development mode: ng serve

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application should now be running.

## Usage

This card game presents a grid of cards that are initially faced down. The objective of the game is to match pairs of cards with the same value by clicking on them.

When you click on a card, it will flip to reveal its value. Click on another card to see if it matches the first card's value. If they match, both cards will remain face up. If not, both cards will flip back to face down. The goal is to match all pairs of cards using as few moves as possible.

Keep track of your moves and try to improve your performance with each game.
